# ggj2020
Galway Game Jam 2020 project

Long ago, the irl nations lived together in harmony (kinda). Then, everything changed when the Covid enablers attacked. Only Cyberpunk 2020, master of all game elements, could stop them, but when the world needed it most, it vanished (then took a dive on release). A dozen days passed and my brother and I discovered the new Game, a VN named [Title Pending], and although its gamining skills are great, it has a lot to code before it's ready to save anyone. But I believe [Title Pending] can save the world.
